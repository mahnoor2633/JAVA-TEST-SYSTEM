In this project i have created a test system. The system provides basic services such as for the teachers it will ask the to create a quiz and then store the questions and marks and answers in a separate file. Then it will provide that quiz to the students and store their answers in a separate file. for providing marks to students it will compare the marks of both the answers of both the students and the teachers then give marks accordingly.
The system is very basic and thus requires some more work.
